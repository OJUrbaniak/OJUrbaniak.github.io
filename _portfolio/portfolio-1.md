title: "**SUBREDDIT CLASSIFICATION USING NLP & ML â€” 2022**"
excerpt: "A Python project which involved the extrapolation of abstract ML data-models from thousands of comments in user-specified lists of \"sub-reddits\" (forums on Reddit.com), after which the user would be prompted to enter a piece of text never before seen to the algorithm. This piece of text would be assed by the various data-models generated earlier, predicting the best-fitting \"subreddit\" depending on the content of the text.<br/><img src='/images/venn_diag_1.png'><br/>Main technologies used:<br/>
* NumPy
* SciKit Learn (SKLearn)
* SpaCy (used for pre-processing)
* Pandas
* MatplotLib
* Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)
* JsonLines
* Git
* IDEA PyCharm
