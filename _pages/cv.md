* 2:1 Bachelor of Science, University of Liverpool, 2018-2021
* (Hopefully) Master of Science, University of Liverpool, 2021-2022

Previous work
======
* Website designer
  * Temporary position at Mark Building Construction during which I created a website for the business, along with setting up Google Ads and Cloudflare CDN, to allow easier access to the business' services and increase outreach. 

* Bar-back 
  * Oddfellows Chester

Skills
======
* Programming skills in order of preference:
  * Python
  * Java
  * C#
  * Swift
  * JavaScript
  * SQL
  * Haskell - :(
* Critical-thinking
  * I had to be highly logical when developing my BSc project due to the complicated nature of machine-learning and text classification. This required me to break down a large initial problem into more manageable sub-sections, employing a divide-and-conquer methodology to the large amount of work ahead of me; this resulted in a 1st classification for my dissertation. 
* Analytical
  * Strong analytical skills were required throughout many of my projects during my time at university; most notably, during a recent literature review on privacy and security for one of my MSc modules and during my BSc project, which involved a large amount of data analysis.
  
Service and leadership
======
* Participating in multiple group projects allowed me to work closely with a variety of people with varying skillsets. Throughout these projects I helped create a supportive working environment which ensured team members felt comfortable putting forward ideas and allowed us to work well collaboratively producing great results.; an example of this is a group project I led which involved developing an Android application backed with a database holding user information. 

The group, composed of 6 members, and initial analysis of skillsets allowed for efficient division of work between the group, with meetings allowing us to discuss progress and any issues pertaining to the completion of the project. I ensured the project was version-controlled to keep track of changes which can be seen on my GitHub account.
