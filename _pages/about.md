MSc Advanced Computer Science student and BSc Computer Science graduate at the University of Liverpool with a vested interest in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and data science. In my spare time I enjoy working on programming projects relevant to my current interests; recently, these have been checkout automation, automatic crypto-currency trading, and app development.

Some of my recent projects can be seen on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/OJUrbaniak) and my [Portfolio](https://ojurbaniak.github.io/portfolio/). The most notable of these is my recent [BSc disseration project](https://github.com/OJUrbaniak/BSc_dissertation) in which I utilized machine-learning in Python to automatically classify unseen text to a user selection of subreddits - this was done by generating ML classification models based on thousands of user-posts already in the subreddit. 

Language skills
======
I'm bilingual in English and Polish with what I would percieve to be great social skills, perhaps due to living in a variety of locations including Poland, the Midlands, and the North West. Moving between each of these locations meant I had to adapt and form relationships with people I would've likely never met before.
